# Set - Duplicate values are not allowed- Insertion order not preserved- Collection    - Set        - HashSet            - LinkedHashSet        - SortedSet            - NavigableSet            - TreeSet    - Set interface doesnot contain any methods, it contains only collection methods## HashSet- It uses HashMap internally to store data.- If we want to add duplicate object, it will return false. It will not throw any compiletime or runtime error- It will store the values on the basis of hashcode of the object- Heterogeneous objects are allowed- Null value allowed- Serilizable and clonable interface implemented- If our frequent operation is search, then this is recomemded- HashMap, HashSet, linkedHashSet, IdentityHAshMap, WeakHashMap, HashTable- HashSet h = new HashSet();- Default capacity 16, load factor/ fill ratio = 0.75```HashSet h = new HashSet(); // with default initial capacity 16 and default fill ratio 0.75Fill ratio : after filling 75 % of the original size of HashSet, a new Object with bigger size will createHashSet h = new HashSet(int initialCapacity); //default fill ratio 0.75HashSet h = new HashSet(int initialCapacity,float loadFactor); ```## LinkedHashSet- It is child class of HashSet- Introduced in 1.4 version- Same as HashSet except below Difference- If duplicate element now allowed and insertion order must be preserved then we use this.## Difference Between HashSet and LinkedHashSet- HashSet underlying Data Structure is HashTable, but LinkedHashSet’s underlying Data Structure is HashTable and linked List- HashSet not preserved Insertion Order but LinkedHashset preserved Insertion Order- HashSet introduced in 1.2 but LinkedhashSet introduced in 1.4>> LinkedHashSet is the best choice to develop Cache based application where duplicates are not allowed and insertion order must be preserved.## SORTED SET- It is the child interface of set- If we want to represent a group of individual According to some sorting order and duplicate are not allowed then we go for sortedset- If we want to represent a group of individual object as a single Entity where duplicates are not are not allowed but all objects should be inserted according to some sorting order then we should go for sortedSet(I)## SortedSet Specific Methods- sortedSet = [100,101,103,104,107,110,115]- Object first()  // 100- Object last(); // 115- SortedSet headset(Object obj); // less than the obj //headset(104) =  100,101,103- SortedSet tailSet(Object obj); // Greater than and Equal to  the obj //tailSet(104) = 104,107,110,115>> Default natural sorting order for numbers is Ascending order and for String is Alphabetical orderWe can implement these methods only on Sorted Set implemented classes, that is on TreeSet Object>> If we want to add null to a non empty treeset, it will throw  NullPointerException. If we add a null to empty TreeSet , it will not throw any exception, because it is not require any comparison to insert Null.>> if we try to add StringBuffer in treeset, it will create RuntimeException because, it does not have default sorting order>> If we are depending on default natural sorting order then object should be Homogeneous and comparable otherwise we will get classCastException at run time. If the class implements Comparable interface, then that class is Comparable Object.>> String class implements serializable and Comparable, but StringBuffer implements Serializable and CharSequence interface. So we can not add StringBuffer to TreeSet, it will show classCastException>> If a treeSet contains some element , then we try to add null to the TreeSet, it will throw null pointer exception because it can’t compare null with some other element present in the TreeSet.>> We can add null to a empty TreeSet.After adding null to Empty TreeSet ,if we add one more element to the treeset it will throw NullPointerException
