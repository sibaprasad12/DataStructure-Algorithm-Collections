# Graph- A graph is a data structure for storing connected data like a network of people on a social media platform.- A graph consists of vertices and edges.- A vertex represents the entity (for example, people) and an edge represents the relationship between entities (for example, a person's friendships).## Directed Graph- If each vertices is pointing to another vertices with direction, i.e each edge have direction## Weighted Graph- our simple graph has edges which are unbiased or unweighted. If instead these edges carry relative weight, this graph is known as a weighted graph.
