## HashTable- A Hash Table is an array of list. Each list is known as a bucket.The position of bucket is identified by calling the hashcode() method. A Hash Table contains values based on the key. It implements the Map interface and extends Dictionary class.- It contains only unique elements.- It canâ€™t have any null key or value.- It is synchronized.## How to iterate HashTable```Hashtable<String,String> hashtable = new Hashtable();hashtable.put("A", "Apple");hashtable.put("B", "Orange");hashtable.put("C", "Mango");hashtable.put("D", "Banana");hashtable.put("E", "Grapes");Set<String> keys = hashtable.keySet();//Obtaining iterator over set entriesIterator<String> itr = keys.iterator();while (itr.hasNext()) {// Getting Key```
